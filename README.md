Created a 3-page view application to capture `Eureka's` main functionalities.
- **Landing view (1st view)** - Show pony for displaying sample field rows
- **Example Form (2nd view)** - Page with fields to be retrieved and passed on
- **Form Data (3rd view)** - Displays data input from previous view
